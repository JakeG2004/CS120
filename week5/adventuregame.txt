As you peer over the edge of the pool, the water becomes uneven. A massive octopus reveals itself!.
Octopus: What is it that you seek, my dear? My name is Octavia and if you solve my puzzle, I can help you however you please.
Answer the riddle? (y/n): y
Octavia: How many tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?
1) 8, since octopuses have 8 tentacles!
2) None. Octopuses can't laugh.
3) Actually only 1. It's surprisingly easy to get an octopus to laugh.
4) 10 Tickles!

Octavia: Fantastic job my dear! Oh how I've missed being tickled. Could you indulge me for just a moment?
Tickle Octavia? (y/n): y
Octavia: HAHAHAHAHHAHA THANK YOU MY DEAR! I forgot what it felt like to laugh. Here, take this as my gratitude.
